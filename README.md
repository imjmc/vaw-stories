Violence Against Women (VAW) Hackathon

It is a platform where the success stories of women who were once a victim of VAW are recorded. This platform helps to encourage other survivors of VAW with the help of success stories of other survivors. It is part of a one day hackathon jointly organised by World Bank with other collaborators. This project grabbed the second prize in the hackathon.
